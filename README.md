In a remarkable collaboration, I had the privilege to work with a thriving ecommerce store seeking a comprehensive data analysis and inventory forecasting solution. Leveraging my expertise in Microsoft Excel, I successfully developed a custom spreadsheet that optimized inventory management and demand forecasting, generating powerful insights for business growth.

Key Features:

Data Integration & Shopify: Seamlessly integrated Shopify's inventory report into Microsoft Excel, enabling weekly updates of sales data.

Sales Tracking & Analytics: Employed advanced data analysis techniques to track weekly sales and provide an in-depth view of the last 2 years' sales trends, fostering data-driven decision-making.

Demand Forecasting: Employed cutting-edge techniques to develop powerful sales forecasts.

Stock Management & Alerts: Implemented robust formulas to track SKU stock levels, providing real-time alerts when inventory approached critical thresholds.

Safety Stock & Supplier Lead Time: Utilized Excel's capabilities to factor in a safety stock of 50 SKU units and considered a 60-day supplier lead time to ensure optimal stock availability.

Order Optimization: Leveraged comprehensive forecasting to calculate precise SKU quantities needed for maintaining a consistent 90-day inventory supply.

SKU Consolidation: Implemented efficient data linking to consolidate SKUs with different names, promoting accurate inventory management.

Outcome:
The project was an extraordinary success, delivering results beyond expectations in a record time of just five days. The clients' 5-star rating and satisfaction attest to the reliability and effectiveness of the customized Excel solution. Equipped with a versatile, data-driven spreadsheet, the ecommerce store now efficiently manages inventory, optimizes stock levels, and makes informed decisions based on accurate forecasts.

This project exemplifies my commitment to leveraging Microsoft Excel and data analysis to empower businesses with powerful tools and data-driven strategies.
